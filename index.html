        Our mission is to provide a caring, healthy and challenging environment where children prepare to meet with confidence, imagination, and integrity, the challenges of life.

 

In partnership with supportive families, we strive to develop in each child the desire and discipline to grow in wisdom, to lead lives of personal honour, to embrace diversity, to appreciate beauty, to pursue physical well being and to interact with others with a generous and compassionate spirit.<br>
        <br>In fulfilling our mission, we subscribe to the following core beliefs:
        <ul>
          <li>
            That the ultimate goal of education is to cultivate in each student a lifelong passion for learning.
          </li>
                    <li>
   That each studentâ€™s academic potential is most fully realized through a challenging and varied curriculum under pinned with appropriate support.
          </li>
          </ul>
